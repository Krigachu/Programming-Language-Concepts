Read from file  -- getLine haskell command reads line
	         -- words haskell command splits string into ["2", "4"]
                            -- "2 4" 
                            -- JORKRI command getLine gets most recent line of fed in file,
                               split it with words, and convert to int
                            -- read haskell command converts string int to int
                            -- map read command to words list to do all and make [int]

PROBLEMS WITH GETLINE, GETLINE RETRIEVES IO SO DATA TYPE IS NO WORKY
use assignment of <- in do to strip IO

iseof                -- tells when end of file in haskell

\/\/ correct our pseudocode

more common functionality?
Add for loops?
