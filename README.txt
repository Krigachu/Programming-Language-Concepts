# JorKri -PLC lang

the bestest language ever maded!!11!1.

Input and Output conventions: 
> streams of ints inputs
> file ends with EOF command
> 32 bit integers (+ve and -ve)
> columns are all the same i.e all lines have same number of args
> number of args in each test may be large but still finite
> empty inputs are allowed
> The values in each row are separated by a single space character.
> form "a_nk" where n = no. columns, k = number of rows
> output should be a stdout in a single column
> Every line must be terminated with the Unix new line character EOL

Language rules (Maybe look at simple languages for inspiration) :
> "Â¬" ending character for line (EOL)
> encapsulate looping with these brackets {}
> for (number to number) {}
> for (something in list) {}
> if (conditions) (number of options) {}
> [] indexing
