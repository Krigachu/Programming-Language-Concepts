--- important notes ---

-- 3 streams as input
-- This is the values from input stream three, then two then one
-- followed by the sum of the same values read from streams one and two
-- sum of the values read from streams two and three. 
-- This is then repeated for the next entries in the input streams.


--- pseudocode ---
List stream1 = file readline !
List stream2 = file readline !
List stream3 = file readline !

List outputStream !
i = 0 !

while (i < length(stream1) && i < length(stream2) && i < length(stream3)) then {
outputStream ++ stream3 index i !
outputStream ++ stream2 index i !
outputStream ++ stream1 index i !
outputStream ++ stream1 index i + stream2 index i !
outputStream ++ stream2 index i + stream3 index i !
i = i + 1 !
}

OUTPUT ( outputStream ) !

-- base case and recurse?
-- updating indexing might be a problem.
--- boundary cases ---

--if empty?
--negative numbers
--numbers over 32 bits
